Historical record of errors and learnings.

## 2026-02-02 - Flutter Widget API Changes
_Problem:_ Used deprecated `withOpacity()` method and incorrect InkWell parameter `onLongPressUp`
_Solution:_ Replaced `withOpacity()` with `withValues(alpha: 0.2)` and switched from InkWell to GestureDetector for proper long-press support
_Lesson:_ Always check Flutter API documentation for latest method signatures; GestureDetector provides more granular control for gestures than InkWell

## 2026-02-02 - Dependency Configuration
_Problem:_ Initially placed provider, http, and shared_preferences in dev_dependencies
_Solution:_ Moved runtime dependencies to dependencies section of pubspec.yaml
_Lesson:_ dev_dependencies are for development tools only; runtime packages must be in dependencies
_Related Files:_ pubspec.yaml
